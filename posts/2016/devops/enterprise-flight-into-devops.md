First time I gave presentation titled *"Enterprise flight into DevOps space"* was in late 2014 at DevConFu conference in Jurmala, Latvia. 
After that, I have delivered the presentation several times during first half of 2015. For some time, I considered that as a closed topic 
and didn't really want to expand on it, until I was asked to deliver it again during Baltic DevOps 2016 conference in Tallinn.    

Enterprise is a word that is highly abused. Most people associate it with slow inefficient processes. Nobody wants to be there! 
At the same time, when I ask audience: *"How many of you work in the enterprise?"* - over 95% raise their hands.
Somehow human nature makes us to prefer simple models of the world. Even though, we, of course, totally understand - world is way more complex. 
Still, we are easily trapped into selecting good vs evil, being a start-up vs being an enterprise, developing microservices vs struggling with a monolith.
So, are most of us really on the evil/wrong side? Probably, not.

I've heard a lot of definitions of DevOps and most likely will hear even more in upcoming years, 
but what I've heard many times is that DevOps is solely related to start-up environments. 
I would like to disagree with that statement. I strongly believe that successful start-ups will come to DevOps culture kind of automatically, 
because it's the only way for them survive and conquer new markets given all the resource and time constraints. 
So, it's not that interesting to talk about DevOps inside start-ups, since they by definition have different approach to business (until they grow big enough and become slow enterprises, of course :)). 

DevOps addresses many issues of small and big companies involved in IT, which is pretty much everywhere. 
Introducing DevOps principles inside slowly moving enterprises will discover inefficiencies and help to optimize processes and teams. 
Talking about DevOps in enterprise is way more important than reflecting on experiences achieved by some high-performing start-ups.     
      
So, here goes the story of Jack the SysAdmin.

End of the story. Well, at least of the first chapter.

When I ask my audience if this story is something they have already seen, I see quite many brave hands and shy nodding heads. Some people even desperately scream: *"Oh, yeah!"*.

The problem is not in technology, the problem
   
   

Unplanned work is hitting both Devs and Ops. 

   
   
   
   
   
## The transformation   

That project/business is going to the same goal and 


The picture above looks a bit like a football game. The two teams have conflicting targets, but they are playing by the rules in constant, and the real goal is not too win each other (even though it will bring ), but bring Nobody wants to watch a game where one team scores 20 goals and other one scores nothing, nobody wants to watch a game where all players get red cards due to misbehaving, 

The analogy with the football game probably can not be fully transffered to IT world, but at least some aspects of it seem interesting to me. 

Communicating 

Of course, the transformation is not as easy as it looks. In my next blog post "Hidden interfaces and untold contracts between Dev and Ops" I will mention some of the easy steps for both sides to take even without implementing full-blown DevOps culture.
